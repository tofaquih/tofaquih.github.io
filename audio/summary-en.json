{"MetaboAgePod":"What we did: We created a way to predict a person's age by looking at small molecules (metabolites) in their blood. We called this 'metabolomic age'.\n Who we studied: We looked at blood samples from a large group (around 12000) of relatively healthy people in the INTERVAL study.\n What we measured: We measured a wide variety of these small molecules, including those made by the body and those from things like medicines.\n How well it worked: Our method was very good at predicting someone's actual age. R2=0.83\n Men vs. Women: We found that these metabolites work differently in men and women as they age.\n Testing it out: We tested our age prediction on another group of people in the NEO study who had different health conditions.\n Health and 'metabolomic age': We saw that people with obesity and heart problems tended to have a 'metabolomic age' that looked older than their real age. This was more noticeable when we included metabolites from things like medications in our prediction.\n Why this matters: Our research suggests that looking at these small molecules in the blood can give us a better idea of how our bodies are aging and how it relates to our health.\n What we shared: We've made our list of measured molecules and how they helped us predict age available for other scientists to use.\n  Future possibilities: Our work could help us understand healthy aging and maybe even predict the risk of age-related diseases in the future.",
"SHSpodcast":" <strong>Our Study: Unraveling the Genetics of Sleep Health</strong> \n      <strong>Who We Studied:</strong> \n413,904 individuals from the UK Biobank of European ancestry \n      <strong>What We Looked At:</strong> \nComposite Sleep Health Scores (SHSs) based on five self-reported measures: \n    Sleep duration \n    Insomnia symptoms \n    Chronotype (morning/evening preference) \n    Snoring \n    Daytime sleepiness \nTwo approaches to create SHSs: \n    Additive Score (SHS-ADD): Sum of five dichotomized positive sleep traits \n    Principal Components-based Scores (SHS-PCs): Five independent scores derived from the underlying traits \n      <strong>How We Analyzed the Data:</strong> \nGenome-wide association studies (GWASs) performed for six SHSs \nLinear mixed regression models used, adjusting for various factors \n      <strong>What We Discovered (Genetic Loci):</strong> \nIdentified 28 significant novel loci associated with SHSs \nFound 341 previously reported loci also associated \nSHS-PCs showed domain-specific genetic discoveries \n      <strong>What We Found (Heritability):</strong> \nHeritability of the first three SHS-PCs was equal to or greater than SHS-ADD \n      <strong>Further Insights (Post-GWAS Analyses):</strong> \nSignificant loci enriched in brain tissues and metabolic/neuronal pathways \nNovel genetic mechanisms underlying sleep health uncovered \nConnections (potential causal links) to behavioral, psychological, and cardiometabolic traits revealed \n      <strong>Validation of Our Findings:</strong> \nAttempted replication in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) \nPolygenic risk scores (PRSs) for most SHSs were validated in HCHS/SOL \nPRSs also associated with clinical sleep outcomes (phecodes) in the MGB biobank \n      <strong>Genes We Implicated:</strong> \nMapped genes at significant loci using various methods \nHighlighted genes with strong evidence involved in neurodevelopment, signaling, metabolism, etc. \n      <strong>Pathways We Found Enriched:</strong> \nIdentified significant enrichments in pathways like MAPK signaling, neuronal system, circadian rhythms, etc., for different SHSs \n      <strong>Genetic Correlations We Observed:</strong> \nNumerous phenotypes genetically correlated with SHS traits, especially with physical and mental health \nEach SHS showed unique patterns of genetic correlations \n      <strong>Potential Causal Links We Explored (Mendelian Randomization):</strong> \nInvestigated causal effects between sleep health and selected traits \nFound potential causal links between lower SHS-PC1 and medication use, lower SHS-PC5 and bipolar disorder, lower SHS-ADD and smoking initiation/education, and reverse effects \n      <strong>Important Considerations (Limitations):</strong> \nSHS-PCs use linear combinations of sleep traits \nOur focus was on five self-reported measures \nGeneralizability of PC loadings might be limited across studies \n      <strong>Overall Conclusion:</strong> \nUsing PC-based SHSs helps distinguish mechanisms of different sleep-related traits \nOur approach enhanced genetic discovery for key sleep health domains",
